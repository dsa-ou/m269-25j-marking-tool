    "Pirates like treasure. A pirate, known as \"Black Ash Vane\", has a map with a lot of treasure troves listed. A treasure trove is a place where treasure is hidden and consists of a name, a total weight of the treasure, the total value of the treasure, and the number of chests the treasure is in. This is important information because a pirate ship can only carry a certain weight of treasure before the ship will become too heavy. You can assume all pirates that have hidden treasure used the same size treasure chests, that a particular trove is a single kind of treasure and hence each treasure chest in the trove will have the same weight and value as every other chest in the same trove. \n",
    "\n",
    "When Black Ash Vane goes treasure hunting, they want to maximise the value of the treasure they put in the hold – more treasure means more rum at the next stop. However, they only ever take whole chests, they never take half a chest or move treasure in and out of different chests. "
